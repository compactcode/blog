title: Where are the commercial Sass snippets?
date: 25/05/2011

I'll be the first to admit that I don't have any real talent for producing beautiful, eye catching web sites. That means I need to rely on sites like [themeforrest](http://themeforest.net/category/site-templates) and [codecanyon](http://codecanyon.net/category/css) to provide me with the necessary creative inspiration.

Lately I have been moving away from working with basic css, preferring more powerful tools like [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) for authoring my stylesheets. 

    :::css
    .date .year {
      @include rounded-corners;
      @include drop-shadow; 
    }

These tools make it easier than ever to package css code into small reusable modules, the kind that could easily be sold on an online market place. Unfortunately I haven't seen anyone doing this and believe me I've looked.

I think there could be a great opportunity for someone to develop and sell Sass snippets on a site like [codecanyon](http://codecanyon.net/category/css). I figure there must be plenty of other developers like me out there willing to buy.
