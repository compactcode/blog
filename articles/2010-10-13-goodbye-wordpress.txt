title: Goodbye Wordpress
date: 13/10/2010

When I started this blog just over a year ago I made the rather foolish decision to host it on my own
[Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) instance. I wasted hours of my time, spent hundreds of dollars and generally ended up more stressed than I ought to be.

#### I wanted something personal

At the time I decided to start the blog I knew there were several options available that would have been easier to
set up. [blogger](http://www.blogger.com) was an option, as was [wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com). Both offered
a limited number of unimpressive, dirt common themes built for the riff raff. I decided that these options were too
impersonal, too lacking in creativity. I wanted something I could customize, so I went with a custom wordpress install.

#### It was harder than I thought

I installed Wordpress on a brand new ubuntu vps server. This of course meant that I was responsible for installing a
database, a mail server, a web server and Wordpress. It's not that these tasks are especially difficult, but if they
aren't something you do a lot you end up wasting a lot of time figuring out less obvious details. For example, your
ip address is likely to be automatically added to a
[spam blacklist](http://articles.slicehost.com/2010/1/20/removing-a-mail-server-from-the-spamhaus-pbl).

#### I found something easier

One day I discovered a very [interesting post](http://fadeyev.net/2010/05/10/getting-started-with-toto/) about a
super simple, super fast blogging tool called [toto](http://cloudhead.io/toto). The entire project is only a few hundred
lines of code which means that even my poor pea brain can actually understand it. If I can completely understand my
blogging tool, I can completely customize it. 

The other advantage of toto is that it is written using Ruby, which means that hosting is a piece of cake. I can just
create a free account on [heroku](http://heroku.com/) and publish articles without needing to worry about servers or
maintenance.

#### I decided to use it

I took the plunge and decided to switch over to toto once I had something worthwhile to post. Since that was unlikely to
happen anytime soon so went ahead and did it anyway. I didn't see much value in
migrating the old posts so I just [moved them](http://compacted.wordpress.com/2010/) and set up some permanent redirect
rules.

Blogging is good again. I have a simple tool that lets me focus on my content, lets me customize it and gets out of my
way. My only remaining dillema is whether I should have used tumblr instead. Ahhh well, perhaps that will make for a
good post next year.
