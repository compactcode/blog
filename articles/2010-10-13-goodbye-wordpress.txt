title: Goodbye Wordpress
date: 13/10/2010

When I started this blog just over a year ago I made the rather foolish decision to host it on my own
[Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) instance. It sucked up hours of my time, reduced the weight of my wallet and generally left me more stressed than I should have been.

#### I wanted something personal

At the time I decided to start the blog I knew there were a few options available that would have been much easier to
set up. blogger.com was an option but was afflicted with the curse of being butt ugly in every regard. wordpress.com
was a better option but had a limited number of themes it supported. I couldn't stomach my sphere of creativity so
closely resembling that of the general internet riff raff. 

#### It was harder than I thought

I installed Wordpress on a [brand new ubuntu vps server](http://www.slicehost.com/). This of course meant that I was
responsible for installing a database, a mail server, a web server and Wordpress. It's not that these tasks are
especially difficult, but if they aren't something you do a lot you end up wasting a lot of time figuring out less
obvious details. For example, your ip address is likely to be automatically added to a
[spam blacklist](http://articles.slicehost.com/2010/1/20/removing-a-mail-server-from-the-spamhaus-pbl).

#### I found something easier

One day I discovered a very [interesting post](http://www.usabilitypost.com/2010/02/06/blogging-simplified/) about a
super simple, super fast blogging tool called [toto](http://cloudhead.io/toto). The entire project is only a few hundred
lines of code which means that even my poor pea brain can actually understand it. Combine that with the fact I'm
comfortable with html, I've got something I can easily personalize. 

The other advantage of toto is that it is written using Ruby, which means that hosting is a piece of cake. I can just
create a free account on [heroku](http://heroku.com/) and publish articles without needing to worry about servers or
maintenance.

#### I decided to use it

I decided to convert this blog over as soon as I had something worthwhile to post. I didn't see much value in migrating the
old posts into toto so I just [dumped them](http://compacted.wordpress.com/2010/) on the free wordpress.com service
and set up some permanent redirect rules.
